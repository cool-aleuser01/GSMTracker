## GSM Tracker

Use cheap unactivated burner phones to as a location tracker.

### Why

I want to know what route my mail takes. I've put one in the mail
to see where it goes.

### How

While an unactivated phone doesn't have access to data or voice,
it still connects with the nearest cellular tower. These towers
have ID's which can then be looked up in a commercial or free 
database.

GSM Tracker runs every hour and logs the current cell tower ID
to a file. When it arrives at it's destination it, the log can
be examined and we can determine what route the phone took.

### The phone

For this expirement picked up a Huawei Inspira SIM 5 Android Prepaid Phone
from Net10 for aroun ~$28. This phone is actually operating on the T-Mobile network
through Net10's MVNO.
